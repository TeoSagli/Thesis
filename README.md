**Making Memories Stick: Designing MR Activities to Reinforce Learning**

Mixed Reality (MR) is showing significant potential in the educational domain; however, existing applications remain largely limited to the reproduction of specific entities—such as objects that are difficult or hazardous to handle in real-life contexts—and to fixed content that cannot be easily adapted. This thesis proposes a novel approach to MR, not merely as a representational tool, but as a means to design customizable, activity-based learning experiences.

This thesis adopts a novel perspective in which MR is not used merely to represent elements of the real world, but rather to create activity-based learning experiences that can be customized according to the users’ desired content. Specifically, it aims to support the memorization and consolidation of knowledge acquired during a pedagogically significant event in students’ educational experience: the school field trip.

The developed application enables educators to create customized and reusable MR activities—such as 2D and 3D puzzles and quizzes—using content (images, videos, 3D models) collected by students during a school trip, with the aim of supporting memory retention through a gamified approach. The system is user-friendly, and the experience is fully customizable in terms of content, directly by the teachers.

The application’s effectiveness was evaluated through two user studies with a total of 37 students. The results from a public demo and a focus group were positive, indicating that participants found the experience highly engaging, comfortable, easy to use, and educationally valuable. The findings demonstrate that a thoughtfully designed MR application can serve as an effective and playful tool for reinforcing memories and learning outcomes from cultural activities, overcoming common limitations of current educational MR applications providing a scalable and highly customizable application in the future.
